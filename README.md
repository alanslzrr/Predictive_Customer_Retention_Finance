# Path to Customer Retention in the Financial Sector

### **Introduction**
This is a common challenge faced by financial companies. The ability to predict and understand the factors contributing to customer churn can make a significant difference in the profitability and success of a financial entity.

This dataset includes some demographic attributes of the clients, as well as information related to their credit cards, including card type, credit limit, revolving balance, among others.

### **Problem Statement**
The main goal is to predict customer churn. By understanding the reasons behind customer attrition, financial institutions can implement **effective retention strategies**, **tailor their products** and **services**, and provide a **personalized** experience to foster customer loyalty.

We will demonstrate how **Data Analysis** and **Machine Learning** can provide a competitive edge by identifying patterns and early signals to address a problem.

To tackle this challenge, we need a structure.
